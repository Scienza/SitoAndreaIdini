                  My main research focus is in nuclear physics. From the understanding of the standard model to stellar bodies, atomic nuclei express the role of the strong force in nature. As such the most important and fascinating objects to study. I am interested the many-body aspects of low-energy nuclear structure and a consistent development of nuclear reactions. Recently, I got interested in statistical approaches to the nuclear many-body problem, to understand what current many-body methods can sensibly infer. <br>
                  Optimization and diagonalization procedures typical of this field can be used to tackle difficult problems in other fields, such as computer vision and reconstructing 3D environments from 2D pictures. <br>
                  Finally, complex systems permeate the world we live in. Studying them can lead to a better understanding of our society and familiar nature.
