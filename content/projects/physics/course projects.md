## Quantum Mechanics course

Analogously to atoms, nuclei also have a shell structure. This relates to their bound states and determine the magicity and stability of elements. However most systems in nature are not isolated but live in an open environment. For example, the size of the nucleus was determined by Rutherford by shooting alpha particles on a gold foil and measuring their scattering directions.
To describe this type of nuclear reactions, one has to represent the quantum system in connection not only with bound states, but with state in the continuum, that are able to fly away to infinity. This is a derivation of the familiar plane wave obtained with the Schroedinger equation of a free particle, but now acting on a potential.

What happens then, when a proton impinges on a nucleus? How did Rutherford from the scattering of alpha particles discovered the size of the nucleus? We will answer these questions through analytical derivations and computing exercises.

## Mathematical methods for quantum mechanics

Calculate nanostructures dissociation energy using solutions of different potentials. This project can be executed either analitically or numerically.
