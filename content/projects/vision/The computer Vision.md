Reconstructing 3D environments from common pictures and videos is one of the fundamental steps towards realising augmented reality and automating transportation. This is known as [theÂ simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) problem.

The efficiency of the algorithms is of paramount importance in order to implement the reconstruction on large scale environments at sub-cm precision. Algebraic methods and parallel computing can be used to enable new methods towards a new range of possible applications.

Within [*Scape Technologies*](http://scape.io), I research on Bundle Adjustment, that is the algorithm comparing a selection of features in pictures and use them to optimise the triangulation of the scene geometry.
